# The Power of Exploratory Data Analysis in a Business Setting


Welcome to the NBA Dataset Presentation Repository! This repository contains the materials and code for a presentation based on an NBA dataset.


## Goal 


We set out to portray the power of EDA in a business setting. Using the same kaggle dataset, we developed 2 different pitches with 2 different ultimate conclusions. This dataset was examined from the perspective of an NBA team’s front office, setting out to increase revenue through whatever metrics possible.  


## Pitch 1 : Take gambles on underrated players 


In this pitch, we explore how we can spot underrated players before they sign large contracts. We look at one specific example, Stephen Curry, who signed a very team friendly contract. This allowed his team to build very strongly around him, in turn creating a dynasty that significantly increased team valuation.


## Pitch 2 : Focus on big name players 


In this pitch, we explore the incomparable impact that big name players have on a team. We show that team success is heavily dependent on all star players, and that it’s worth spending the extra money to recruit these players to our team.
